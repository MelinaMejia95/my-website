        Mentorship is one of my greatest passions. Over the years, I’ve had the
        privilege of guiding aspiring developers and professionals through their
        tech journeys. As a verified mentor on ADPList, I help individuals from
        diverse backgrounds improve their skills, navigate career transitions,
        and build confidence in the ever-evolving tech industry.

      <p>
        Seeing my mentees grow, achieve their goals, and unlock their potential
        is incredibly rewarding—it’s why I love what I do. If you’re looking for
        someone to support and inspire your journey in tech, let’s connect
        through <a href="https://adplist.org/mentors/melina-mejia-bedoya">my ADPList profile!</a>
